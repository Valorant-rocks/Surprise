                    I dont really do these Valentine Shananigans really because i dont like the concept that for a particular week of a year I have to express my love via gifts and that shi while I love you UNCONDITIONALLY. Istg, i really really love you unconditionally and so so much. I will never ever in my whole life let you go. You complete me. The way you have transformed me, from glowups to character maturity, idk how i will ever repay you. Jati choti thank you bhaneni pugdaina.

                    You've always wondered and said that we are opposites and we fight more than others. I mean True on both counts, but still, being opposite is so so nice. I have this whole ass new person who thinks the opposite way I do and provides me so much valuable insights in my life. Hola kahile kai dispute aauxa hola tara never ever have I minded this and I really hope we can evolve our relationship centering our "oppositeness" not as a reason of our dispute but as a reason why we are so perfect of each other.

                    Though, probably the next 5-7 years are going to be spent apart with occasional meetings in between, I promise I will forever remain faithful because i have never and dont think will ever love anyone the way I do to you. I promise Smarika, I will take care of you and always be loyal till death do us apart.
